winxedxx - A C++ backend for winxed

(C) 2011 Juli√°n Albo "NotFound"

Initial revision with bare minimal features.

        * Supported systems.

I'm building and testing only in Linux with g++. It may work in other *ix.

        * Differences with parrot winxed.

The string type is currently implemented as a std::string, so there are
no null strings.
